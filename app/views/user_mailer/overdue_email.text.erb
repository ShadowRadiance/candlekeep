# You have overdue books at Candlekeep. #

You have the following books at Candlekeep that are currently overdue!

<% @checkouts.each do |checkout| %>
- <%= checkout.copy.book.title %>
  - Due: <%= checkout.due_at.in_time_zone(@user.time_zone).to_s(:long) %>
<% end %>

Please return them. It would be a *shame* if we had to send the monks.

Many thanks,

The Seer
